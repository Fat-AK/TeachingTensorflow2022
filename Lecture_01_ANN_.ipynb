        "A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. It is composed of layers of interconnected \"neurons,\" which process and transmit information. Neural networks can be trained to perform a wide variety of tasks by adjusting the strengths of the connections between neurons, known as weights.\n",

They have been used to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation.\n",

        "There are several types of neural networks, including feedforward networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Each type is suited to different types of tasks and can be trained using a variety of algorithms, such as backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent."
